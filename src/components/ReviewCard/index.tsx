          <S.Description>
            &quot;Don&apos;t Make Me Think&quot; by Steve Krug is one of the
            first books I read when I was getting into digital design. It helped
            me move from designing things that just &quot;look nice&quot; to
            designing things that are usable, useful, memorable and simple to
            learn and use.
